* #### [Final Project](http://kikijinqili.github.io/CIM640-JinqiLi//homework/final/index.html)

## Project Idea:
* #### I have been influenced and attracted by many kinds of science-fiction artworks including animations, movies, novels and installations from my childhood. Among all of these great works, Sailor Moon might be the first one that introduced me to the world of space opera. For my nostalgia of the old time, I tried to make up a 3D webpage showing the space in Sailor Moon to my understanding which is a colorful and fantastic space full of love and courage. However, due to my limited capability of web design, the project is still incomplete. But I hope to make it a perfect work in the future.
* #### The inputs are usersâ€™ actions in the two GUIs.
* #### The outputs are the changes in the type of planets, and the diameter, rotating speed, and location of the planets.
* #### The target audience for this project is people who are interested in Sailor Moon or any science-fiction works.
* #### This project might be displayed on a fan-page of Sailor Moon.

## 3 potential ideas:
* #### An animation showing how solar system works
* #### An VR game simulating experience of space traveling
* #### An webpage for customizing the virtual planets
